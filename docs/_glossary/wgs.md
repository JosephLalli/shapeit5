title: WGS
---

WGS stands for whole-genome sequecing data. When not specified, WGS is intended at high coverage, from 30x of coverage or more, therefore the quality of genotype calling is high.

Sometimes the term low-coverage whole genome sequencing is used, in this case we indicate data of a coverage <= 8x (up to 0.1x or even less). Very often this data needs to be imputed in order to be usable.
