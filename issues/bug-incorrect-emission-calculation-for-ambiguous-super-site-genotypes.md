### Bug: Incorrect Emission Calculation for Ambiguous Super Site Genotypes (AMB)\n\nThe emission calculation for ambiguous (AMB) super site genotypes is flawed in `phase_common/src/models/haplotype_segment_single.h`. The current implementation incorrectly splits the 8-lane AVX2 vectors into two 4-lane halves to handle the two different alleles, as seen in `SS_INIT_AMB`, `SS_RUN_AMB`, and `SS_COLLAPSE_AMB`. This logic does not respect the `amb_code` bitmask, which should determine the allele orientation for each of the 8 lanes independently. This leads to incorrect emission probabilities for all ambiguous heterozygous genotypes at super sites, significantly impacting phasing accuracy. The logic should be updated to use the `amb_code` to create masks for each allele and then blend the emissions per lane.
